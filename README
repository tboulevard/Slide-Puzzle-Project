This is a repository for the slide puzzle project I worked on in the Fall 2013 
offering of CS 2114 - Software Design & Data Structures. We designed our game
to take in *any* picture and reformat it to fit on our slide puzzle board.

The project was open ended with the following requirements:
  
  1. Must be an Android application.
  2. Must ultilize an algorithm in a useful or interesting way.
  3. Must be a game or utility.
  
We were also required to write our own JUnit and Android test cases.
